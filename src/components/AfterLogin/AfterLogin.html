                symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places. This can be voluntarily

                 malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever. Seek medical help.

                 people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.</p>
